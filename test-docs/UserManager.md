# UserManager

The `UserManager` class handles user operations and authentication.

## Dependencies

This class depends on:
- [DatabaseConnection](DatabaseConnection.md) for data persistence
- [Logger](Logger.md) for logging operations
- [ValidationService](ValidationService.md) for input validation

## Usage

```rust
struct UserManager {
    db: DatabaseConnection,
    logger: Logger,
    validator: ValidationService,
}
```

The UserManager implements user CRUD operations and integrates with [AuthenticationService](AuthenticationService.md).
